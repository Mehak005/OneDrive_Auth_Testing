# OneDrive Authorization Testing Framework

## Introduction
This project probes authorization behavior on a OneDrive using Microsoft Graph. It creates files with different sharing states (private, view link, edit link, direct invite), exercises them with multiple audiences (owner, invited user, normal user), and compares observed API outcomes to an expected policy.

## Methodology
- **Policy model:** `policy_model.py` defines expected ALLOW/DENY for (audience × visibility × action) in a OneDrive context.
- **Client wrapper:** `onedrive_client.py` wraps Graph calls for file CRUD and sharing, including share-link access via `/shares/{shareId}/driveItem` and direct invites via `/invite`.
- **Test harness:** `test_framework.py` sets up four files, applies sharing (view/edit links, direct invite), then runs all policy scenarios per audience and records results/responses.
- **Tokens:** Uses three tokens (owner, invited user, normal user) loaded from `owner_token.txt`, `collab_token.txt`, `external_token.txt`. Tokens are acquired with `./fetch_token.py`, which runs MSAL interactive auth.

## Policy and Factors
- **Audiences:** `owner` (token holder), `invited_user` (direct invitee on `collab_file.txt`), `normal_user` (no sharing).
- **Visibilities:** `private` (no sharing), `public_view_link` (anonymous view link), `public_edit_link` (anonymous edit link), `collab_invite` (direct invite to edit a file).
- **Actions:** `read`, `write`, `delete`, `share`.
- **Expected behavior:** owner ALLOW everything; view link allows read only (when accessed via link), edit link allows read/write, direct invite allows read/write, others DENY.

## Experimental Setup
- **Environment:** Python with `requests`, MSAL (`msal`), and access to Microsoft Graph for a personal account.
  - After cloning this repository, create a virtual environment `python -m venv venv` and activate the venv using `./venv/Scripts/activate` for windows (or) `./venv/bin/activate` on Linux or MacOs.
  - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the virtual environment.
  
  - In order to run the tests, you first need 3 Azure accounts to act as an owner, invited user and a normal user.
  - From one account, create an APP registration and add other two accounts as owners so that all the accounts can run the APIs locally.
  - Add these in the `./config.py`
    ```
    CLIENT_ID = ""
    CLIENT_SECRET= ""
    AUTHORITY_URL = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
    SCOPES = ["Files.Read", "Files.Read.All", "Files.ReadWrite", "Files.ReadWrite.All", "Sites.Read.All", "Sites.ReadWrite.All", "User.Read"]
    ```
  - Once the Azure account setup is done, we need to acquire a token for each user by running the `fetch_token.py`.
  - You need to run it thrice by choosing different user each time. Confirm if the tokens are generated by checking `./owner_token.txt`, `./collab_token.txt`, and `./external_token.txt`.
  
  - **Run the Tests**
  - Run `python ./test_framework.py` to run the tests. You'll be able to see the logs to know which stage you're on.
  - Once done, the results will be generated in the `./results/` directory with test results separated by user type.
  
- **Files created:** `private_file.txt` (no sharing), `public_view.txt` (anonymous view link), `public_edit.txt` (anonymous edit link), `collab_file.txt` (direct invite with write role).
- **Sharing artifacts:** For non-owner access, the harness stores `share_id` from `share_file`/`invite_user` responses and uses `/shares/{shareId}/driveItem` for read/write/delete/share.
- **Running tests:** `python test_framework.py` (requires populated token files). Results export to `results/test_results_*.json`.
## Experimental Results
Recent run highlights (see `takeaways.md` for details):
- **Owner**: 16/16 scenarios passed as expected.
- **Invited user**: 11/16 passed. 
  - Anonymous links DENY when accessed via another user’s bearer token; collab invite allowed delete/share (write role grants broad edit).
- **Normal user**: 13/16 passed. 
  - Same anonymous link behavior—DENY via token.

Key takeaway: Anonymous links must be tested anonymously (using the `webUrl` without a token) or treated as DENY when accessed through a different user’s Graph token. Write invites allow delete/share unless you invite with `role='read'` or adjust expectations accordingly.
